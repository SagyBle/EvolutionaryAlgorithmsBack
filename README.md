# EvolutionaryAlgorithmsBack

### Welcome to our mini-project in EvolutionaryAlgorithms course.

## Steps to run our program:
### Initialize the UI:
  * Download the EvolutionaryAlgorithmUI from this [repositry](https://github.com/SagyBle/EvolutionaryAlgorithmUI).
  * Make sure you have "node.js" package installed.
  * Open the terminal inside this directory.
  * Run "npm start" in the terminal.
  * Open Google Chrome Browser in url: http://localhost:3000/.
  * Maybe the local host opened on other port, be aware and change by it.

### Initialize the server:
  * Download the EvolutionaryAlgorithmBack from this [repository](https://github.com/SagyBle/EvolutionaryAlgorithmsBack).
  * Make sure you have "uvicorn", "fastapi", "fastapi.middleware.cors", "eckity", "numpy" packages installed.
  * Run "main.py" to start the server.

### Run all together:
  * Insert players data via the UI (there are also example data buttons).
  * Insert number of teams.
  * Press "get results" button.
  * pressing this button will parse the data and transfer it to the backend, make the calculations using ec-kity library, parse it back and send it to the UI.
  * Now you can see the results,  on the bottom of the page.


enjoy!
